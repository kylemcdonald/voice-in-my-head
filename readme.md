$HOME/anaconda3/bin/conda init
source ~/.bashrc
rm Anaconda3-2023.09-0-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

Create the environment:

```sh
conda create -y -n vimh python=3.9
conda activate vimh
conda install -y -c conda-forge libstdcxx-ng # needed for daily-python
conda install -y pytorch torchvision torchaudio cpuonly -c pytorch
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Setup nginx:

## Setting the Duration

The duration of the experience is controlled in the .env file.

## Notes on sound design

Sounds should match the audio stream:

* 1 channels (mono)
* 44.1kHz
* 16-bit depth

Note they might get slightly glitched by the compression and streaming algorithms.

They should also always fade out quickly, or sometimes they can create a lingering noise.

`helpers/prepare-sound.sh` will help prepare sounds for this format.

## Notes on the script

Each row of the script has a function, input and output.

The function is the name of a function instead the `VoiceInMyHead` class. The input is the input to that function, and the output is where the output is saved.

When you save output to a variable, you can reference that as an input in later rows.

If a variable is referenced in a `speak` line, it should be surrounded by {curly braces}. (This is because the `speak` lines get preprocessed and combined.)
